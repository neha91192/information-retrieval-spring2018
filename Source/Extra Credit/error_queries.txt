i am intreested in artciles written either by prieve or udo pooch 
intremediate languages used in construction of mulit-targeted compilers tcoll 
im intreested for comumnicating between disjoint processes possibly but not exculsively in a disrtibuted envrionment i would rather see desrciptions complete mechanisms with or without impelmentations as opposed to theroetical work on the abstract problem remote procedure calls and mesasge-passing are examples of my interests 
id like papers impelmentation of editing interfaces winodw-managers command intrepreters etc the essential issues are human interface design with views on imporvements to user efficiency effcetiveness and satsifaction
